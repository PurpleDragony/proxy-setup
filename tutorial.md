# Private proxy setup tutorial
Some institutions block certain websites, making it difficult to execute certain commands. (`apt update` I'm looking at you :3)<br>
A solution to this is to set up a private proxy and use that to reroute everything through a different service provider.<br>
# Prerequisites 
- computer that will connect to the proxy<br>
- computer that will be the private proxy server<br>
